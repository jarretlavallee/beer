So I am sick of not knowing the temperature that I am pitching at. I was
thinking of doing 1 of 2 things.

**A**. Recirculate my cooled wort back into the kettle using my PID in
cool mode attached to the march pump to get it down to my pitching
temps.

**B**. Put a thermometer inline and do A for manual monitoring.

**C**. Put a thermometer inline and put the wort directly in the
fermenter, manually tweaking the flow and temperature.

In any of the ways above, I would prefer to watch the temps while it is
cooling. Whats fun of having all of these toys and not being able to
watch the temps? So I guess I am building an inline thermometer.

The idea behind this one is to make a inline thermometer for my plate
chiller. I want it to be hot -pluggable so that it can easily be cleaned
and be detached. I also plan to put this inline with my pump in my
brutus 20. It should be dynamic, cheap, and easy to clean/sanitize.

 

**Requirements**:

1.  Hot-Plugable:  Everything I have that is plumbed is attached with
    quick disconnects. The inline thermometer should not be an
    exception.
2.  Cheap: I will use Brass and a stainless 1/2in threaded 2.5 in
    thermometer
3.  Free Flowing: The thermometer rig should not introduce too much
    resistance. I want my march pump to be able to pump high enough to
    get to the top of my Mash Tun.

<div>

1.  1/2 in threaded thermometer
2.  1/2 in T or Y. Brass
3.  1/2 in female quick disconnect threaded
4.  1/2 in male quick disconnect threaded
5.  Teflon tape

Pretty simple design.

<div>

female QD - T - male QD

</div>

<div>

**Potential Problems**:

</div>

<div>

-   Thermometer stem may be too long to go on the top of the T. I would
    have to swap the male QD and the thermometer.
-   If I swap the male QD and thermometer, it will introduce some
    resistance and may limit the flow.
-   It may be too heavy for the plastic mount on my plate chiller (Lets
    hope not)
