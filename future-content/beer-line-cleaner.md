I used to have a Professional Beer Line Cleaner. It was awesome and I
used it less than I should have. Well somehow in a move I seem to have
accidentally thrown it away along with my favorite growlers. So I need a
new one. Well I do not want to pay \$36+ shipping for a [new one][].
Some awesome person on hbt made one cheaply from home depot
parts.[link][]

 

**Parts list:**

 

-   [Flo-Master Model 56HD][] \$7
-   Ball lock liquid post. I already have this from old kegs
-   3/8 Flare to FIP adapter \~\$2

<div>

Total: \~\$10

Pretty cheap for what it is. I like how this one actually connect to the
liquid disconnect instead of to the shank. It will help clean the taps
with out have to take them off.
