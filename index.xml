I scalled down to 2.5 gallons and found that lasts about a month or more about 2 weeks. It is an ideal amount for Morgan and me as we will not get sick of any particular beer. I will however need to scale up my pipeline. Since it is winter and I can no longer enjoy the hop aroma and flavor, I have decided to start phasing into mouth feel beers for a while.</description></item><item><title>Rye Revenge</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/rye-revenge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/rye-revenge/</guid><description>It has been quite a while since I have been brewing. Now I have a different setup and live in a different part of the country. I just brewed the House Amber and that has been fermenting for a month. It is now time to start on the next beer. I have been in love with the Terrapin Rye, so I figured I would try a clone. There are many clone recipies out there, so I copied this fro many of those.</description></item><item><title>Canning Wort</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/techniques/canning-wort/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/techniques/canning-wort/</guid><description>One of the most aggravating things about making a starter is that you have to boil the wort to sanitize. I would throw some DME, yeast nutrient and water into the clean flask. You then boil the wort in the flask and flash chill it. The whole process takes a while and if done one at a time is too much work. I recently bought a pressure cooker and it has made my life SO much easier.</description></item><item><title>Fugly Blonde</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/fuggle-blonde/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/fuggle-blonde/</guid><description>Here is a basic one that I brewed up today. The homebrew store was closed so I used what I had on hand. I had one pound of golden home roasted malt on hand (25 minutes at 300 deg) so I made this one up. I kept this simple because I wanted to use the pacman yeast that I harvested from Rogue bottles.
Pre Boil: 7 Gallons 10 Brix (76.5% efficiency)</description></item><item><title>Wheatever</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/wheatever/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/wheatever/</guid><description>Simple recipe for a wheat that I made. It is fermenting now and started at 5 gallons 12 brix (12/10/11). Mashed at 152 deg.
UPDATE: I kegged it at 5.5 brix on 12/30/11. It is estery yet nice. It seems that it will be an easy wheat beer. (5.6% abv)
6 lbs White Wheat
4 lbs 2 Row
1 oz Hallertau @ 60 Min
Wyeast 1010 (washed)</description></item><item><title>Blonde Rye</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/blonde-rye/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/blonde-rye/</guid><description>Here is a blonde rye I want to make. This is a try at a repro of my favorite rye I have ever made, hence the belgian yeast. I originally made one before loosing my recipes and I accidentally racked it onto a 550 yeast cake. It was ridiculously delicious.

He has excellent ideas and was a great brewing partner. He came up with this recipe and it was light and delicious. So this is not technically a wheat beer, but whatever.
The secret to this recipe is the placement of the cranberries. Basically after the boil, you dump the boiling hot wort onto 4 lbs of frozen cranberries.</description></item><item><title>Fine Gael Irish Ale</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/fine-gael-irish-ale/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/fine-gael-irish-ale/</guid><description>In 2009 I did my first all grain. I went out and bought a turkey fryer and a home depot 5 gallon cooler. I made what I thought was a SS braid ( turned out to be some sort of plastic) and started a mash with it. To my surprise, I was able to make it through the batch with out any trouble. I batch sparged, missed my numbers and ended up spilling some wort.</description></item><item><title>Red Rye</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/red-rye/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/red-rye/</guid><description>So I want to brew up a red rye with the hops that I have. Here is what I am thinking.
UPDATE: I brewed this today (12/4/11) and it smells awesome. Mashed at 154 and ended up with 5.5 Gallons at 13 Brix.

The idea behind washing yeast is to wash it. Essentially you take the yeast cake from a previous beer and rinse the yeast and then store them in the fridge. It only take a few minutes and you can save a bunch of money on yeast by doing this. A single yeast cake can go a long way with washing yeast. The down side is that you need to create yeast starters.</description></item><item><title>Brown Town</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/brown-town/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/brown-town/</guid><description>I brewed this one up a few weeks back. I finally kegged it after a month in the fermenter. It is still carbonating, but I tasted it today and it is very nice. It has a nice nut flavor as you would expect with a Nut Brown. I will brew this again.
UPDATE: I tasted this again today and it is delicious. It is not as full bodied as I hoped, but I like it better than other Nut Browns that I have tasted.</description></item><item><title>Centennial Blonde</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/centennial-blonde/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/centennial-blonde/</guid><description>Here is a basic blonde that I want to make. Its based on Centennial hops with a basic grain bill. It tastes like a hefe.
  7.00 lb Pale Malt (2 Row) US (2.0 SRM)
0.75 lb Cara-Pils/Dextrine (2.0 SRM)
0.50 lb Caramel/Crystal Malt - 10L (10.0 SRM)

It does not hav e Norther Brewers hops, but it will hopefully taste good. I used my home made Dark Amber Malt for the first time! I also did a First Wort Hop, which I have never done before. We will see how it turns out.
UPDATE: This tastes AWESOME. It is really malty and the color is beautiful. Its a nice dark red. You can taste the home roasted malts, but thats because I roasted them the day before.</description></item><item><title>House Amber</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/house-amber/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/recipies/house-amber/</guid><description>This is my favorite recipe. I have not made this in a year or so, but I am going to get a nice pipeline of this going again and dedicate a tap for it. Maybe I will make a special tap handle for it. This normally comes out to 6.3% abv

Ok&amp;hellip; in reality its been over a year. I thought this would be a great idea back in January 2010 and went out an bought all of the pieces. I ended up building my kettle and the chiller/pump toolbox and never actually making the controller. The design is mostly from jkarp on HBT. I customized this idea for my environment.</description></item><item><title>Dark Amber Malt</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/techniques/dark-amber-malt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/techniques/dark-amber-malt/</guid><description>So last week I decided that I wanted to start home roasting my own malts. I found some awesome information here. I decided to make the dark amber malt.
I set up the oven at 375 and put 2 pounds of malt in the oven for 45 minutes. DAMN did it smell good. I am very excited for this one to be done.
I am very excited to try this one out in a brew.</description></item></channel></rss>
