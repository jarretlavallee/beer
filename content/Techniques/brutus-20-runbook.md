So I figured that I would get a runbook for the new Brutus 20 system. It
is unedited and may change, but below is version 1.


**Overview:**
=============

1.  Hose up the equipment for mashing
2.  Heat up the strike water while recirculating.
3.  Fill the Mash tun
4.  Dough in
5.  Mash
6.  Heat sparge water
7.  Recirculate all water raising overall temp to 170
8.  Fill BK
9.  Boil
10. Hop additions
11. Hose up equipment for chilling
12. Run boiling wort through the chiller to sanitize
13. Turn off BK and turn on the cold water in plate chiller
14. Rack the wort into fermenter
15. Pitch yeast
16. Cleanup

**Details:**
============


This is not so different from a normal brew day, with the exception that
there is no pouring or lifting involved here. The pump is supposed to do
all of that for me. The first part is setting up the hoses.


1. Hose up the equipment for mashing
------------------------------------

Set up all of the equipment for mashing. My kitchen is very small and
there is little counter space so I set up the BK on the stove (I do not
use the burner on the stove). Next to that I put the pump/plate chiller
tool box. Next to that I have the Mash Tun on top of a homer bucket. On
the right of that I put the controller box.


Setting up the hoses for mashing is as depicted below. The BK feeds into
the pump which pumps the water up to the Mash Tun. I use gravity to feed
the Mash Tun back into the BK.

2. Heat up the strike water while recirculating.
------------------------------------------------

I fill up my BK with my strike water and then set my PID to my strike
temperature. Next I open up the ball valve on the BK and prime the pump.
The pump gets turned on and I start filling up the Mash Tun. When I have
about 2.5 gallons left in the BK, I open up the ball valve on the Mash
Tun. Since the Mash tun cannot keep up with the flow rate, I limit the
ball valve on my pump to try to match it. When the are about equal I
leave it for a few minutes and check again. Make sure not to let the BK
get too low or you will burn out the heating elements.

Since my controller and BK are set up with 2 burners I have the ability
to use one or both of them. When heating up the strike water I tend to
use both because I want the speed up the process.  While this is going I
measure out and grind up my grains into a separate bucket.


3. Fill the Mash Tun
--------------------

This is an easy step. Once the water is at the strike temperature I fill
up the BK. All I do is turn off the heating elements and then close the
ball valve on the Mash Tun.

4. Dough in
-----------

Double check the temperature in the Mash Tun with a floating
thermometer. If it matches up, pour in the grains and stir it up. Keep
stirring until there are no dough balls and until you hit your mash
temp.

5. Mash
-------

This one is straight forward. Put 60 minutes on the timer and wait for
30 minutes before going to the next step.

6. Heat Sparge Water
--------------------

After 30 minutes in the mash, I fill up my BK with my sparge water. I
then set my PID to the sparge temp and only enable 1 heating element.
This will generally hit the sparge temp in 5 minutes, but I leave the
extra time just in case. At this time I will stir up the mash and double
check the temperature.

7. Recirculate all water raising overall temp to 170
----------------------------------------------------

When the mash is done, set the PID to 170 and then open the ball valve
on the Mash Tun half way. Next you need to turn on the pump form the BK
to match the speed of the flow from the Mash Tun. This is very hard to
do. I end up setting it, watching my sight glass and checking back every
2 minutes. Make sure not to overflow the Mash Tun. Let this go for 30
minutes. Remember to keep the wort level in the BK between the sparge
water level and the strike water. Any more or less may overflow the Mash
Tun or not leave enough water to sparge the grains.

8. Fill BK
----------

After the 30 minutes of recirculating, stop the pump and close the ball
valve on the on the BK. This will fill the BK. At this time I set the
PID to manual mode and put it on 100% with both heating elements on.

9. Boil
-------

Boil like you normally would. I can control the boil as I choose. You
can turn on either burner, set the PID to any percentage as you choose.
I normally do a 60 minute boil. At this time I will normally start
cleaning the Mash Tun and putting it away.

10. Hop additions
-----------------

Hop additions are made in hop bags. Do this as per the recipe you have
created.

11. Hose up equipment for chilling
----------------------------------

This is the hose setup for chilling the wort. The BK feeds into the pump
which pumps the wort through the chiller and back into the BK. I leave
the controller connected so that I can monitor temps while it is
recirculating.

12. Run boiling wort through the chiller to sanitize
----------------------------------------------------

With 15 minutes left on the boil I turn on the pump and start running
boiling wort through the plate chiller. This will sanitize the plate
chiller and get everything primed for the actual chilling. Remember to
leave the coolant water off at this time.

13. Turn off BK and turn on the cold water in plate chiller
-----------------------------------------------------------

At this time the boil is done. Turn off the heating elements on the PID.
Turn on the coolant water. The PID will continue to monitor the
temperature in the wort, so keep recirculating until it is down to
pitching temps. At this time I will sanitize the fermenter. This is nice
because it aerates the wort with air in the BK.

14. Rack the wort into fermenter
--------------------------------

At this point everything is hosed up and chilled down. I turn off the
pump then move the hose from the top of the BK into the fermenter. Since
the wort is at the temperature that we want to pitch at, we turn off the
collant water. Turn on the pump and let the fermenter fill up. Hose

15. Pitch yeast
---------------

The fermenter is filled up, wort cooled and its time to pitch the yeast.
The throw it in the fermentation chamber ( closet in my case)

16. Cleanup
-----------

I generally dump the BK and give it a nice rinse. I then fill it up and
turn on the pump to flush the chiller with clean water. The out hose
goes into the sink. After the water is running clean I put it back into
the chilling hose configuration. I will turn on the PID at 150 with one
heating element and let it run for 10 minutes. I then switch the hoses
to flush the plate chiller in the opposite direction.

Once everything is running clean, I dump all water sponge all parts and
put everything away. Your done.
