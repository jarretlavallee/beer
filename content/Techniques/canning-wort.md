One of the most aggravating things about making a starter is that you
have to boil the wort to sanitize. I would throw some DME, yeast
nutrient and water into the clean flask. You then boil the wort in the
flask and flash chill it. The whole process takes a while and if done
one at a time is too much work. I recently bought a pressure cooker and
it has made my life SO much easier.

When using canned wort, starters only take a few minutes to prepare. You
essentially sanitize the flask, funnel and the usual
sanitization procedures then you dump in the wort, the yeast and the
stir bar. That's it. The best part is that the wort is initially
sterile, so you can culture samples from fewer yeast cells.

The best part is that they are sterile and therefore last indefinitely.
I keep them in my closet at room temperatures. I am experimenting with
my storage media as it may make it easier for smaller starters. For now
I only do quart sized canned wort (12 of them make 3 gallons). When I
need a smaller amount for a starter, I will pour in only a bit. The rest
gets capped an in the fridge until I am ready to step up the starter.


### Steps for canning wort:

1.  Dissolve 1 lb/ gallon of DME in hot water (3 gallons worth)
2.  Add yeast nutrient into wort
3.  Add 1/4 ounce of old hops (1/4 ounce in 3 gallons)  
    The hops are antibacterial so it will help avoid bacterial
    infections in the starters. This also means that starters should
    stay out of the light.
4.  Fill the mason jars about 1/4 in below the rim
5.  Put the lids on, screw on the tops and then back turn 1/4
6.  Put an inch of water into the pressure cooker (3 cups) and a
    tablespoon of vinegar (To avoid etching on the glass)
7.  Fill the pressure cooker with the mason jars
8.  Put on the lid and turn the burner on high
9.  When there is a solid stream of steam coming out of the pressure
    release, put the weight on
10. Let the pressure build up to 12 psi and then turn down the heat
11. Let the pressure rise to 15 psi and stabilize the
    pressure/temperature
12. Wait 20 minutes
13. Turn off the heat and move the pressure cooker off the burner
14. Wait an hour and ensure that the pressure is 0 psi
15. Open the pressure cooker and screw the lids fully on the mason jars
16. Let the mason jars cool to room temperature slowly


I leave the jars of wort in the closet. When they cool, you will see a
lot of hot break in the bottom of the jars. Feel free to ignore it as it
should have no affect on the starter. That said, I do decant the wort
off of the hot break when I pitch the starter.


### Using canned wort for a starter:

1.  Fill the flask up with sanitizer
2.  Drop the stir bar in the sanitizer and attach it to the side with a
    magnet
3.  Take the ring off of the jar
4.  Sanitize the lid of the jar and your hands (If the lid is not
    depressed do not use the wort)
5.  Take a 3x3 piece of tinfoil and sanitize it
6.  Empty the flask
7.  Pop the lid off of the mason jar and decant the wort off the hot
    brea into the flask
8.  Pitch the yeast
9.  Put the sanitized tinfoil on the top of the flask and bend the sides
    over
10. Swirl the flask
11. Remove the side magnet
12. Put the flask on the stir plate, sliding it from side to side to
    catch the stir bar on the stir plate


When using a small amount of wort, do the same procedure above for the
small starter, but only use a small amount. After decanting the wort,
put the lid back on and put it in the fridge until you are ready to step
the starter. If your sanitization procedure is good, you will still have
sanitized wort in the mason jar. It will not be sterile after opening,
but it should be fine if everything was sanitized properly. So it should
last a week or 2 in the fridge. I normally step it after krausen on the
smaller starter, so a few days depending on the amount of source yeast.
