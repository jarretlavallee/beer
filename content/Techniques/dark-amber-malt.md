So last week I decided that I wanted to start home roasting my own
malts. I found some awesome information [here][]. I decided to make the
dark amber malt.

I set up the oven at 375 and put 2 pounds of malt in the oven for 45
minutes. DAMN did it smell good. I am very excited for this one to be
done.


I am very excited to try this one out in a brew.
