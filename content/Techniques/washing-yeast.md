title: Washing Yeast
---

So washing yeast is easy cheap and efficient. The idea behind washing
yeast is to wash it. Essentially you take the yeast cake from a previous
beer and rinse the yeast and then store them in the fridge. It only take
a few minutes and you can save a bunch of money on yeast by doing this.
A single yeast cake can go a long way with washing yeast. The down side
is that you need to create yeast starters. Since I already have a home
made stir plate it is not a big deal, except it means no more last
minute recipes. Also it put a dent into the double brew days.


All of the information came from [here][].

Equipment
---------

1.  A 4 quart (1/2 Gal) Mason jar
2.  6 pint Mason jars ( 4 can be used)
3.  4 Gallon Pot
4.  Tongs
5.  Water

Steps to washing yeast
----------------------

1.  Brew a beer and ferment with your favorite yeast
2.  Boil Mason jars
3.  Fill Mason jars with boiled water
4.  Chill water overnight
5.  Rack beer off of the yeast cake
6.  Pour the cold water from all of the mason jars into the carboy
7.  Shake it like a baby
8.  Let the trub settle out
9.  Decant the yeast filled water into the big mason jar
10. Let the trub settle out again
11. Decant the yeast filed water into the small jars
12. Label the jars and put them in the fridge.


If reusing the yeast that day, you can just pitch one of the mason jars.
If using it at a later date I step it up with a yeast starter, throw it
in the fridge over night, decant the non yeast water and pitch the
slurry.


The yeast is only really viable for 6 months. I still have mason jars
with yeast from 2 years ago, but it is the color or peanut butter so I
am going to toss it. Nearing the end of 6 months, all you have to do is
make a starter out of one of your mason jars and step it up large enough
to get more mason jars out of it. You can throw it on another beer and
then wash it again, but late generations of yeast start to pick
up certain attributes. I old did this with the same beer to try to make
it consistent. Considering you can cut a single \$7 vial into 6 parts I
think its not that bad to repurchase, but it can be done. To properly do
it I would suggest slanting yeast ( I really want to do this, but I need
a place that is consistent to justify the equipment cost).


Remember to keep everything sanitized. This means spraying down the
counter, lids, hands and you mother. Just make sure to keep it all
sanitized. A burning candle will help keep dust from settling in the
area.
