title: Poblano Stout
---

I am getting back into brewing and have made a few batches recently. I scalled down to 2.5 gallons and found that lasts about a month or more about 2 weeks. It is an ideal amount for Morgan and me as we will not get sick of any particular beer. I will however need to scale up my pipeline. Since it is winter and I can no longer enjoy the hop aroma and flavor, I have decided to start phasing into mouth feel beers for a while. This should be a nice winter stout with some subtle heat. I got the idea from Big Sky Brewing. They have a nice Poblano stout that I tasted a few years ago, and it is time to get oen going. 

The idea for this one is to make an oatmeal stout and then throw in some roasted, skinless, seedless, diced poblanos into the secondary. I will dice them and put them in a bag and drop it into the keg on day 5. 

Note Thie recpie is for my 3 gallon BIAB setup. The flameout hops actually go into the keg for no chill. I will be doing the following pressure ferment schedule. The goal is to reduce the fermentation time. I will take some samples to see how hot it gets and I may pull the peppers out. 

 * Day 1: Cooling - 
 * Day 2: Pitch Yeast set pressure to 2 PSI 
 * Day 3: Increase pressure to 6 PSI 
 * Day 5: Add Poblanos - Pressure at 6 PSI 
 * Day 7: Cap Pressure 
 * Day 14: Cold Crashed 
 * Day 15: Racked to keg
