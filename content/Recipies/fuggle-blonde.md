---

Here is a basic one that I brewed up today. The homebrew store was
closed so I used what I had on hand. I had one pound of golden home
roasted malt on hand (25 minutes at 300 deg) so I made this one up. I
kept this simple because I wanted to use the pacman yeast that I
harvested from Rogue bottles.

Pre Boil: 7 Gallons 10 Brix (76.5%Â efficiency)  
Post Boil: 5.5 Gallons 12 Brix


> 9 lbs 2 row  
>  1 lb Home Roasted Golden  
>  1 oz Fuggles FWH  
>  .5 Willamette 15 min  
>  .5 Fuggles 10 min  
>  .5 Willamette 5 min  
>  PacMan Yeast
