In 2009 I did my first all grain. I went out and bought a turkey fryer
and a home depot 5 gallon cooler. I made what  I thought was a SS braid
( turned out to be some sort of plastic) and started a mash with it. To
my surprise, I was able to make it through the batch with out any
trouble. I batch sparged, missed my numbers and ended up spilling some
wort. Although this was much better than the time I bled into my beer,
it was pretty bad. I really enjoyed mashing and learning the new
techniques. So despite the first time with all grain I continued to brew
all grain. Any way, in 2011 I lost all of my recipes. I know that I am a
storage guy and should have had backups, well I did. I had them stored
on my phone, a backup image of my phone, on a website hosted locally and
an rsync copy of the website. Well I guess you do not have backups
unless you test them. It seems like simultaneously I lost it in all
places. My phone crashed and my backup image of brewpal was corrupted.
At the same time I found that the hard drive holding the data died ( I
tried the freezer trick, no go). I went to retrieve them off the website
and it turns out that a week before they had removed all of my old
accounts and that was gone as well. I through all was lost and started
over again.

Well today I remembered that last year I set up a vps from Amazon and
that it had a version of the brew wiki ( the vps that hosts this blog).
http://brewwiki.moopless.com. Unfortunately It was a really old version
and was missing most of my recipes. However, It did have my first all
grain recipe Fine Gael Irish Ale. I remember this one tasting delicious.
That could have just been my hubris talking, but it was great. Below is
the recipe.
