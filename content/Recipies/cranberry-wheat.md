title: Cranberry Wheat

So I give full credit of this recipe to my old roomante Andrew Wood. He
has excellent ideas and was a great brewing partner. He came up with
this recipe and it was light and delicious. So this is not technically a
wheat beer, but whatever.

The secret to this recipe is the placement of the
cranberries. Basically after the boil, you dump the boiling hot wort
onto 4 lbs of frozen cranberries. You let this sit for 20 minutes and
then put it back in the BK, bring to a boil again and then chill.


     9 lb 2-row
     0.5lb wheat
     0.5 Honey
     0.5 Crystal 10l
     1 oz Glacier 60 min
     1 Pkg us-05
     4 lb frozen cranberries
