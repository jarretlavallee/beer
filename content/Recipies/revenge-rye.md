It has been quite a while since I have been brewing. Now I have a different setup and live in a different part of the country. I just brewed the House Amber and that has been fermenting for a month. It is now time to start on the next beer. I have been in love with the Terrapin Rye, so I figured I would try a clone. There are many clone recipies out there, so I copied this fro many of those. I did however, modify it to use Cascase and Armarillo hops as I have those readily available. 

Note Thie recpie is for my 3 gallon BIAB setup. The flameout hops actually go into the keg for no chill. I will be doing the following pressure ferment schedule.

 * Day 1: Cooling - Done 11/05/2014
 * Day 2: Pitch Yeast set pressure to 2 PSI - 11/06/2014
 * Day 3: Increase pressure to 6 PSI - 11/07/2014
 * Day 5: Dry Hop - Pressure at 6 PSI - 11/10/2014
 * Day 7: Cap Pressure - at 12 PSI 11/12/2014
 * Day 13: Pressure at 18 PSI 11/18/2014
 * Day 24: Cold Crashed - Pressure at 25 PSI 11/29/2014
 * Day 25: Racked to keg
