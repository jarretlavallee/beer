Here is a blonde rye I want to make. This is a try at a repro of my
favorite rye I have ever made, hence the belgian yeast.
I originally made one before loosing my recipes and I accidentally
racked it onto a 550 yeast cake. It was ridiculously delicious.

 

>     7 lb 2-row
>     2lb Rye Malt 
>     1lb Flaked Corn (Maize)
>     1lb American White Wheat 
>     1oz Cascade pellet 60 min
>     1oz Cascade pellet 10 min
>
>     WLP550 Belgian Yeast
