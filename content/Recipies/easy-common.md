This is a non traditional Common. It does not hav e Norther Brewers
hops, but it will hopefully taste good. I used my home made [Dark Amber
Malt][] for the first time! I also did a First Wort Hop, which I have
never done before. We will see how it turns out.


UPDATE: This tastes AWESOME. It is really malty and the color is
beautiful. Its a nice dark red. You can taste the home roasted malts,
but thats because I roasted them the day before. Next time I will let it
sit in a brown bag for 2 weeks.
