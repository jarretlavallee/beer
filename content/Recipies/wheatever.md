Simple recipe for a wheat that I made. It is fermenting now and started
at 5 gallons 12 brix (12/10/11). Mashed at 152 deg.


UPDATE: I kegged it at 5.5 brix on 12/30/11. It is estery yet nice. It
seems that it will be an easy wheat beer. (5.6% abv)


> 6 lbs White Wheat  
>  4 lbs 2 Row  
>  1 oz Hallertau @ 60 Min  
>  Wyeast 1010 (washed)
