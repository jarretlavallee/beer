I brewed this one up a few weeks back. I finally kegged it after a month
in the fermenter. It is still carbonating, but I tasted it today and it
is very nice. It has a nice nut flavor as you would expect with a Nut
Brown. I will brew this again.


UPDATE: I tasted this again today and it is delicious. It is not as full
bodied as I hoped, but I like it better than other Nut Browns that I
have tasted. It is VERY smooth and easily drinkable. I carbonated this
one while much less carbonation than I do on other beers and it is
delicious.
