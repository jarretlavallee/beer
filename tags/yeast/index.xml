I would throw some DME, yeast nutrient and water into the clean flask. You then boil the wort in the flask and flash chill it. The whole process takes a while and if done one at a time is too much work. I recently bought a pressure cooker and it has made my life SO much easier.</description></item><item><title>Washing Yeast</title><link>https://beer.hubnut.ga/techniques/washing-yeast/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jarret.lavallee@gmail.com (jarret)</author><guid>https://beer.hubnut.ga/techniques/washing-yeast/</guid><description>So washing yeast is easy cheap and efficient. The idea behind washing yeast is to wash it. Essentially you take the yeast cake from a previous beer and rinse the yeast and then store them in the fridge. It only take a few minutes and you can save a bunch of money on yeast by doing this. A single yeast cake can go a long way with washing yeast. The down side is that you need to create yeast starters.</description></item></channel></rss>
