I finally kegged it after a month in the fermenter. It is still carbonating, but I tasted it today and it is very nice. It has a nice nut flavor as you would expect with a Nut Brown. I will brew this again.
UPDATE: I tasted this again today and it is delicious. It is not as full bodied as I hoped, but I like it better than other Nut Browns that I have tasted.</description></item></channel></rss>
